## Technologies Used
- CSS
- HTML

## Context

- The static comp project tested my abilities to match a provided comp. This provided comp included a somewhat complex layout involving a title section with a dashboard, and eight boxes of content. These boxes had similar properties but slightly different information. My comp has a movie theme, but it does roughly match the layout of the comp provided. I put my HTML and CSS skills to the test to match this comp.

## Application Set-Up

1. Fork repository on GitHub.

2. `Git clone` the repository to your local machine.

3. `Cd` into the directory.

4. Run `open index.html
